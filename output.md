_#_ 1. _Introduction_

These _exercises_ are intended to stimulate _discussion_, and some might be
set as _term_ _projects_. Alternatively, preliminary _attempts_ can be made
now, and these _attempts_ can be reviewed after the _completion_ of the
book.

**1.1** _Define_ in your own _words_: (a) _intelligence_, (_b_) artificial _intelligence_,
(_c_) _agent_, (d) _rationality_, (e) logical _reasoning_.

**1.2** Read _Turing_’s original _paper_ on AI _@Turing:1950_. In the _paper_, he
discusses several _objections_ to his proposed _enterprise_ and his _test_ for
_intelligence_. Which _objections_ still carry _weight_? Are his _refutations_
valid? Can you think of new _objections_ arising from _developments_ since
he wrote the _paper_? In the _paper_, he predicts that, by the _year_ 2000, a
_computer_ will have a 30_%_ _chance_ of passing a five-_minute_ Turing _Test_
with an unskilled _interrogator_. What _chance_ do you think a _computer_
would have _today_? In another 50 _years_?

*_*_1.3** Every _year_ the Loebner Prize is awarded to the _program_ that comes
closest to passing a _version_ of the Turing Test. _Research_ and report on
the latest _winner_ of the Loebner _prize_. What _techniques_ does it use? How
does it advance the _state_ of the _art_ in AI?

**1.4** Are reflex _actions_ (such as _flinching_ from a hot _stove_) _rational_? Are
they intelligent?

**1.5** There are well-known _classes_ of _problems_ that are intractably difficult
for _computers_, and other _classes_ that are provably undecidable. Does
this mean that AI is impossible?

**1.6** Suppose we extend Evans’s *SYSTEM* _program_ so that it can score 200 on a _standard_
_IQ_ _test_. Would we then have a _program_ more intelligent than a _human_?
Explain.

**1.7** The neural _structure_ of the _sea_ _slug_ *Aplysia* has been
widely studied (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only
about 20,000 _neurons_, most of them large and easily manipulated.
Assuming that the _cycle_ _time_ for an *Aplysia* _neuron_ is
roughly the same as for a human _neuron_, how does the computational
_power_, in _terms_ of _memory_ _updates_ per second, compare with the high-_end_
_computer_ described in (_Figure_ [_computer_-_brain_-table](#/))?

**1.8** How could _introspection_—reporting on one’s inner _thoughts_—be inaccurate?
Could I be wrong about what I’m thinking? Discuss.

**1.9** To what _extent_ are the following _computer_ _systems_ _instances_ of
artificial _intelligence_:

-   Supermarket _bar_ _code_ _scanners_.

-   _Web_ _search_ _engines_.

-   Voice-activated _telephone_ _menus_.

-   _Internet_ _routing_ _algorithms_ that respond dynamically to the _state_ of
the _network_.

**1.10** To what _extent_ are the following _computer_ _systems_ _instances_ of
artificial _intelligence_:

- Supermarket _bar_ _code_ _scanners_.

- _Voice_-activated _telephone_ _menus_.

- _Spelling_ and _grammar_ _correction_ features in Microsoft Word.

- _Internet_ _routing_ _algorithms_ that respond dynamically to the _state_ of the _network_.

**1.11** Many of the computational _models_ of cognitive _activities_ that have been
proposed involve quite complex mathematical _operations_, such as
convolving an _image_ with a Gaussian or finding a _minimum_ of the _entropy_
_function_. Most _humans_ (and certainly all _animals_) never learn this _kind_
of _mathematics_ at all, almost no _one_ learns it before _college_, and
almost no _one_ can compute the _convolution_ of a _function_ with a Gaussian
in their _head_. What _sense_ does it make to say that the “_vision_ _system_”
is doing this _kind_ of _mathematics_, whereas the actual _person_ has no _idea_
how to do it?

**1.12** Some _authors_ have claimed that _perception_ and _motor_ _skills_ are the most
important _part_ of _intelligence_, and that “higher _level_” _capacities_ are
necessarily parasitic—simple _add_-_ons_ to these underlying _facilities_.
Certainly, most of _evolution_ and a large _part_ of the _brain_ have been
devoted to _perception_ and _motor_ _skills_, whereas AI has found _tasks_ such
as _game_ _playing_ and logical _inference_ to be easier, in many _ways_, than
perceiving and acting in the real _world_. Do you think that AI’s
traditional _focus_ on higher-_level_ cognitive _abilities_ is misplaced?

**1.13** Why would _evolution_ tend to result in _systems_ that act rationally? What
_goals_ are such _systems_ designed to achieve?

**1.14** Is AI a _science_, or is it engineering? Or neither or both? Explain.

**1.15** “Surely _computers_ cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their
_programmers_ tell them.” Is the latter _statement_ true, and does it imply
the former?

**1.16** “Surely _animals_ cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their _genes_
tell them.” Is the latter _statement_ true, and does it imply the former?

**1.17** “Surely _animals_, _humans_, and _computers_ cannot be intelligent—they can do
only what their _constituent_ _atoms_ are told to do by the _laws_ of
_physics_.” Is the latter _statement_ true, and does it imply the former?

**1.18** Examine the AI _literature_ to discover whether the following _tasks_ can
currently be solved by _computers_:

- Playing a decent _game_ of _table_ _tennis_ (Ping-Pong).
- Driving in the _center_ of Cairo, Egypt.
- Driving in Victorville, California.
- Buying a _week_’s _worth_ of _groceries_ at the _market_.
- Buying a _week_’s _worth_ of _groceries_ on the _Web_.
- Playing a decent _game_ of _bridge_ at a competitive _level_.
- Discovering and proving new mathematical _theorems_.
- Writing an intentionally funny _story_.
- Giving competent legal _advice_ in a specialized _area_ of _law_.
- Translating spoken English into spoken Swedish in real _time_.
- Performing a complex surgical _operation_.

**1.19** For the currently infeasible _tasks_, try to find out what the
_difficulties_ are and predict when, if ever, they will be overcome.

*_*_1.20** Various _subfields_ of AI have held _contests_ by defining a standard _task_
and inviting _researchers_ to do their best. _Examples_ include the DARPA
Grand Challenge for robotic _cars_, the International Planning
_Competition_, the Robocup robotic _soccer_ _league_, the TREC _information_
_retrieval_ _event_, and _contests_ in _machine_ _translation_ and _speech_
_recognition_. Investigate five of these _contests_ and describe the
_progress_ made over the _years_. To what _degree_ have the _contests_ advanced
the _state_ of the _art_ in AI? To what _degree_ do they hurt the _field_ by
drawing _energy_ away from new _ideas_?
